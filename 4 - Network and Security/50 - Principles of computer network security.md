Principles of computer network security (cryptography and message integrity).

Once again, suuuper vague description, so I will only go through the basics. This is like an ENTIRE field!
check the book for more details I guess.

Quick reminder of terms:


- **Confidentiality** – Preventing unauthorized access (e.g., encryption)
	`Can anyone see my data except the reciever?`
    
- **Integrity** – Detecting unauthorized modification
	`Is data sent same as data recieved or did someone change it?`
	
- **Authentication** – Verifying identity of the sender
	`Is this user allowed to see the data?`
	
- **Non-repudiation** – Preventing denial of sent messages
	`Will the user recieve the message or will it be interupted?`
