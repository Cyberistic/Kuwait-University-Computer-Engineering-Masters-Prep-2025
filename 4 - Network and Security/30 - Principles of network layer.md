`Kurose and Ross, the Networkin layer is discussed in Chapter 4
_____
### 1. Network layer:

The **network layer** is the third layer in the **OSI model**. Its main function is to:

- **Deliver packets from the source to the destination** across multiple networks (also called internetworking).
    
- **Handle logical addressing**, typically using **IP addresses**.
    
- **Route data** by determining the best path through the network (routing).
    
- **Fragment and reassemble packets** if necessary.

### 1.1 Key Responsibilities:

- **Logical addressing** (e.g., IP addressing)
    
- **Routing** (finding the best path to the destination)
    
- **Packet forwarding** (move packets from router‚Äôs input to appropriate output)
    
- **Packet fragmentation and reassembly** (the process of breaking down large packets into smaller ones for transmission and then rebuilding them at the destination)
    
### 1.2 Protocols used:

- **IP (Internet Protocol)** ‚Äì IPv4, IPv6
- **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- **Ethernet & WIFI**

> üîç **Fragmentation**? When a router receives a datagram (packet) that's larger than the allowed transmission of the outgoing link, it splits the datagram into smaller pieces (fragments). These fragments are sent separately and reassembled at the final destination.
> üîç **NAT**? allows multiple devices on a private network to share one public IP address when accessing the Internet, uses NAT translation table to keep track of IPs.

#### 3.1 Why IPv6 and not IPv4?
- **Address exhaustion**: IPv4 has a limited number of IP addresses (about 4.3 billion), and with the growing number of internet-connected devices, we are running out of IPv4 addresses.
    
- **Larger address space**: IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space (approximately 340 undecillion addresses), allowing for an almost unlimited number of unique addresses for devices.
    
- **Improved routing efficiency**: IPv6 simplifies network routing, making it more efficient and scalable.
    
- **Better security**: IPv6 was designed with security in mind, including mandatory support for IPsec, which helps secure communications (IPSec is a must!).
    
- **Better performance**: IPv6 has features like auto-configuration and simplified header structure, leading to potentially better performance compared to IPv4.
    
- **Support for modern technologies**: IPv6 supports emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), that require a large number of IP addresses and constant connectivity.

### 3.2 IPv4 Addressing & Subnets
#### 3.2.1 . **Understanding IP Addressing:**

- **IP Address**: An IP address is made up of 4 octets (32 bits for IPv4, 128 bits for IPv6). Each octet has 8 bits, which means there are 256 possible values (0‚Äì255) per octet.
    
- **Subnet Mask**: A subnet mask divides the IP address into the network and host portions. For IPv4, it's typically written in dotted decimal notation (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
#### 3.2.2 **Understanding IP Addressing:**
- **Class A**: `0.0.0.0` to `127.255.255.255` (default subnet mask `255.0.0.0`)
    
- **Class B**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255` (default subnet mask `255.255.0.0`)
    
- **Class C**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255` (default subnet mask `255.255.255.0`)
    
- **Class D (Multicast)**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
    
- **Class E (Reserved)**: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`

#### 3.2.3 **Subnet Calculation Steps:**

**a.** **Determine the Network Address:**

To find the network address, perform a **bitwise AND** operation between the IP address and the subnet mask. For example:

IP Address: `192.168.1.10` Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`

Convert them to binary:

- `192.168.1.10` = `11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010`
- `255.255.255.0` = `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`

Perform the **AND** operation:
```
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
AND
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
-----------------------------------
11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
```
> The result is `192.168.1.0`, which is the **network address**.
> ‚≠ê TRICK: the network address is always the FIRST available address.

 **b.** **Calculate the Broadcast Address:**

To find the broadcast address, invert the subnet mask and **OR** it with the network address.

Inverting the subnet mask `255.255.255.0` gives `0.0.0.255`. Now OR it with the network address `192.168.1.0`:
```
11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
OR
00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111
-----------------------------------
11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111
```
> The result is `192.168.1.255`, which is the **broadcast address**.
> ‚≠ê TRICK: the broadcast address is always the LAST available address.

**c. Determine the Number of Hosts:**

The number of hosts per subnet is determined by the number of bits left in the subnet mask.

For `255.255.255.0` (or `/24`):

- For every 255 -> 8 bits are used.
- 32 bits (total bits) - 24 bits (used bits) = 8 bits for the host part.
- Number of hosts available = `2^8 - 2 = 254` (we subtract 2 for the network and broadcast addresses).

### 3.2.4 **Subnetting:**

If you want to create smaller subnets, you can "borrow" bits from the host portion and adjust the subnet mask accordingly.

For example, if you take a `/24` network (`255.255.255.0`) and borrow 2 bits for the subnet:

New subnet mask: `255.255.255.192` (or `/26`).

- The new subnet mask allows for `2^2 = 4` subnets, and each subnet will have `2^6 - 2 = 62` hosts.

### 3.2.5 **IP Address Range:**

For each subnet, the usable IP range is from the network address + 1 to the broadcast address - 1.

For the subnet `192.168.1.0/24`:
`(Remember: /24 means that our subnet is 255.255.255.0 which leaves us with 254 hosts)`

- Network address: `192.168.1.0`
- Usable range: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`
- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.255`
