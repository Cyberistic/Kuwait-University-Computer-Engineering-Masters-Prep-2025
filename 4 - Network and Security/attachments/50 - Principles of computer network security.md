Principles of computer network security (cryptography and message integrity).

Once again, suuuper vague description, so I will only go through the basics. This is like an ENTIRE field!
check the book for more details I guess.

Quick reminder of terms:
Network security ensures:

- **Confidentiality** – Preventing unauthorized access (e.g., encryption)
    
- **Integrity** – Detecting unauthorized modification
    
- **Authentication** – Verifying identity of the sender
    
- **Non-repudiation** – Preventing denial of sent messages
