### 1. Background
	
- Program must be brought (from disk) into memory and placed within a process for it to be run.
	
- Main memory and registers are only storage CPU can access directly.
	
- Register access is done in one CPU clock (or less).

### 2. Fragmentation (┘Ё┘ѓпип╣)
When memory is allocated and freed, it can become **broken into pieces**, leading to **fragmentation**.

> ­ЪцЊРўЮ№ИЈ **Fragmentation** occurs in **contiguous memory** systems, where memory is allocated in **one single block** (cannot split data). Welp this means that fragmentation IS the problem in contiguous memory.

**Types of Fragmentation:**
	
1. **Internal Fragmentation**
		happens when the allocated block is larger than needed, causing unused space within the same block.
		
	- **Cause**: Fixed-size memory blocks (like in paging).
	    
	- **Wasted space** _inside_ allocated memory.
	    
	- Example: You allocate 100KB but only use 90KB, so 10KB wasted.
	
 2. **External Fragmentation**
		happens when there are small unused gaps scattered between allocated blocks.
		
	- **Cause**: Variable-size memory blocks (like in segmentation).
	    
	- **Wasted space** _between_ allocated memory blocks.
	    
	- Example: Enough total free memory, but not in one big chunk.

**2.1 Internal Fragmentation (Horizontal Layout)**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A["Total Memory Size (500 KB)"] 
    B["Process 1 (200 KB - Used 180 KB)"]
    C["Free Space (20 KB)"]
    D["Process 2 (150 KB)"]
    E["Process 3 (150 KB)"]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E

    style A fill:#2196F3,stroke:#1976D2,stroke-width:2px;
    style B fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#388E3C,stroke-width:2px;
    style C fill:#F44336,stroke:#D32F2F,stroke-width:2px;
    style D fill:#FFEB3B,stroke:#FBC02D,stroke-width:2px;
    style E fill:#FFEB3B,stroke:#FBC02D,stroke-width:2px;

```
`As you can see a lot of empty space that's not used properly!

**2.2 External Fragmentation (Horizontal Layout)**:

    C["Free Space (50 KB)"]
    D["Process 2 (100 KB)"]
    E["Free Space (150 KB)"]
    F["Process 3 (50 KB)"]

### 3. Paging

We take our **virtual memory** and divide it into chunks called **PAGES**.
Then we take our **physical memory** and divide it into chunks called **FRAMES**.
	­ЪЉЅ Page size will always be qual to frame size!
	
Unlike Fragmentation paging happens in non contiguous system were data don't need to be stored all together in one block.

![[Paging hardware-1.png]]

**How do we implement it?**
	Lets just jump into an example problem:

>[!question] Assume, physical memory of size 32 Byte, Page size 4 B, Logical memory of size 64 Byte.
a) How many pages are there in the logical memory?
b) How many frames?
c) How many bits are used for the offset

Lets solve (a) first:
$$\#\text{ of pages} = \frac{\text{Logical Address (LA) Size}}{\text{Page Size}} = \frac{2^6}{2^2} = 2^4 = 16$$

Next, (b):
$$\#\text{ of frames} = \frac{2^5}{2^2} = 2^3 = 8$$

Finally (c):

$$
m - n = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ bits}
$$

> [!NOTE] Personally i don't think this will come in the exam ;)

### 4. Paging Vs Fragmentation 

| Feature                | Paging                                         | Fragmentation            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Memory Allocation      | Non Contigoues                                 | Contigoues               |
| Fragmentation Possible | Only Internal                                  | External and Internal    |
| Speed                  | Slight overhead because of address translation | Direct addressing (Fast) |
| Flexibility            | More flexible                                  | Less flexible            |
`These were all the fuetures i could think of.. ;d`
