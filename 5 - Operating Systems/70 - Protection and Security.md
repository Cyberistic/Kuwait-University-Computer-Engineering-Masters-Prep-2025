## 🔐 **Protection and Security – Summary**

### ✅ **Protection**

- **Goal**: Prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
    
- **Key Concepts**:
    
    - **Access Control**: Determines who can access what.
        
    - **Domains of Protection**: Logical grouping of resources with access rights.
        
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give users/processes only the access they need.
        
    - **User Authentication**: Verifying user identity (passwords, biometrics, etc.).
        
    - **Protection Mechanisms**:
        
        - **Static** (fixed at compile time)
            
        - **Dynamic** (changes at runtime)
            

### 🛡️ **Security**

- **Goal**: Defend system from external/internal threats.
    
- **Key Areas**:
    
    - **Threats**:
        
        - **Program Threats**: Trojan horses, viruses, worms.
            
        - **System Threats**: DoS attacks, port scanning.
            
        - **Network Threats**: Spoofing, sniffing, replay attacks.
            
    - **Encryption**:
        
        - **Symmetric** (same key)
            
        - **Asymmetric** (public/private key pairs)
            
    - **Security Policies**: Rules for secure system behavior.
        
    - **Firewalls & Intrusion Detection**: Block or alert on suspicious activity.
