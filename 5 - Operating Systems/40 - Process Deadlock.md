### 1. Deadlock Characterization

Deadlock only happens when all the following are **true**:

1. **Mutual exclusion:** only one process at a time can use a resource.
2. **Hold and wait:** a process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
3. **No preemption:** a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task.
4. **Circular wait:** there exists a set {P0, P1, …, Pn} of waiting processes such that P0 is waiting for a resource that is held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource that is held by P2, …, Pn–1 is waiting for a resource that is held by Pn, and Pn is waiting or a resource that is held by P0 (بطتنا بطت بطتكم).

### 2. Deadlock Prevention (Break one of the above!)

Enduring that the system will **NEVER** enter a deadlock state!

- **Deny Mutual Exclusion** (Not practical for non-sharable resources like printers).
- **Deny Hold and Wait**  
   → Require processes to request all resources at once.  
   🔸 Downsides: Can cause **low resource utilization** and **starvation**.
- **Deny No Preemption**  
   → Allow system to **forcibly take resources** if a process is waiting.  
   🔸 Used in CPU scheduling or memory management sometimes.
- **Deny Circular Wait**  
   → Impose a **fixed order** of resource requests (number resources & request in increasing order).  
   🔸 Simple and commonly used.

### 3. Deadlock Avoidance

Enduring that the system will **NEVER** enter a deadlock state!
**🎯 Key Idea:**
Before allocating resources, the system checks if doing so keeps it in a **safe state** (where all processes can finish eventually).
**🧠 How It's Done:**
Each process tells the system its **maximum resource needs** in advance. then the system uses algorithms to **simulate** allocations and check if the result is **safe**.
**📌 Drawbacks:** - Requires knowing **max needs** ahead of time. - More **complex** and **costly** than prevention.

> [!INFO] there is something called the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance that checks if the allocations are safe or not... you can take a look at it in the book.
