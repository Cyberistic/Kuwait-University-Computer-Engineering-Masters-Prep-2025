**Topics:**

1. Computer system overview.  
2. Process management: Process versus thread, CPU scheduling algorithms, threads and concurrency.  
3. Process synchronization: classical synchronization problems (critical-section, readers-writers, dining philosophers, etc.), and synchronization tools (semaphores, monitors, etc.).  
4. Process deadlock: deadlock model and methods for handling deadlocks: prevention, avoidance, and detection and recovery.  
5. Memory management: Memory allocation techniques (paging vs segmentation), virtual memory (replacement algorithms, page-frame allocation relation, and thrashing), file system (access methods, file and directory structures, and file and directory implementation).  
6. Input/Output and File Systems: I/O hardware, application I/O interface, kernel I/O interface, access methods, directory structure and memory mapped files.  
7. Protection and security.  
8. Virtual Machines: Benefits and features, types of VMâ€™s and their implementations, and virtualization and operating-system concepts.
