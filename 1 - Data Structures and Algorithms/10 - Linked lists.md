## Singly Linked Lists

![[Singly Linked List.png]]

A _Singly Linked Lists_ is a list of nodes, each node has 2 properties:

1. Stored value (Can be a pointer to an object)
2. Reference to next node (its "address" in memory)

We only need to track the address of the Head, and then we can then find any node by traversing the list by _pointer hopping_.

We can identify the tail (last node) of the last if its next value is `None`. I usually like to have a reference to the end value as well, such that adding elements to the linked list doesn't require traversing the entire list.

So in general, this is how it would look like:

```ts
type Node = {
  id: string; // (optional) if you want to search by id
  value: number;
  next: Node | null; // if null then it's tail
  count: number; // Always nice to have the total number of nodes
};

type LinkedList = {
  head: Node | null;
  tail: Node | null;
  // + Rest of functions like add, etc.
};
```

So in this implementation, adding or removing nodes should be straightforward:

1. Add at start (Head):

```ts
// Complexity: O(1)
function addToHead(linkedList: LinkedList, newNode: Node) {
  newNode.next = linkedList.head;
  linkedList.head = newNode;
  linkedList.count++;
}
```

2. Add at end (tail):

```ts
// Case 1: We are keeping track of tail
// Complexity: O(1)
function addToTail(linkedList: LinkedList, newNode: Node) {
  linkedList.tail.next = newNode;
  linkedList.tail = newNode;
  linkedList.count++;
}

// Case 2: Not keeping track of tail
function addToTail(linkedList: LinkedList, newNode: Node) {
  let current = linkedList.head;
  while (current.next) {
    current = current.next;
  }
  current.next = newNode;
  linkedList.count++;
}
```

3. Add in the middle:

```ts
// let's say we want to search for id and add after it
// Complexity: O(n)
function addAfterId(linkedList: LinkedList, id: string, newNode: Node) {
  let current = linkedList.head;
  while (current) {
    if (current.id === id) {
      break;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }
  newNode.next = current.next;
  current.next = newNode;
}
```

Removing nodes is a bit more tricky, because we need to keep track of the previous node as well. So we can do something like this:

```ts
// Complexity: O(n)
function removeById(linkedList: LinkedList, id: string) {
  if (linkedList.head === null) {
    return;
  }
  linkedList.count--;
  // if we are keeping track of tail, we need to check if we are removing the last node
  if (linkedList.tail === linkedList.head) {
    linkedList.tail = null;
  }
  // if we are removing the head
  if (linkedList.head.id === id) {
    linkedList.head = linkedList.head.next;
    return;
  }
  // if we are removing a middle or tail node
  let current = linkedList.head;
  let previous = null;
  while (current) {
    if (current.id === id) {
      break;
    }
    previous = current;
    current = current.next;
  }
  previous.next = current.next;
  current = null; // or use a garbage collector, or implement a destructor, or just let it live in memory forever lol
}
```

Same thing with other remove operations, just do the addition operation "backwards" so to speak.
So for example, removing the head would look like this:

```ts
// Complexity: O(1)
function removeHead(linkedList: LinkedList) {
  if (linkedList.head === null) {
    return;
  }
  linkedList.count--; // if we are keeping track of tail, we need to check if we are removing the last node
  if (linkedList.tail === linkedList.head) {
    linkedList.tail = null;
  }
  linkedList.head = linkedList.head.next;
}
```

### Applications

#### Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the _Last In First Out (LIFO)_ principle. It can be implemented using a singly linked list. The top of the stack corresponds to the head of the linked list, and we can add or remove elements from the top of the stack in constant time _O(1)_.

```ts
// to push to stack
function push(linkedList: LinkedList, newNode: Node) {
  addToHead(linkedList, newNode);
}
// to pop from stack
function pop(linkedList: LinkedList) {
  if (linkedList.head === null) {
    return null;
  }
  const poppedNode = linkedList.head;
  removeHead(linkedList);
  return poppedNode;
}
```

I added full code for [[Implementing A Stack using Python]], take a quick look at it.

#### Queue

A queue is a data structure that follows the _First In First Out (FIFO)_ principle. It can be implemented using a singly linked list. The front of the queue corresponds to the head of the linked list, and we can add elements to the end of the queue in constant time O(1).

```ts
// to enqueue
function enqueue(linkedList: LinkedList, newNode: Node) {
  addToTail(linkedList, newNode);
}
// to dequeue
function dequeue(linkedList: LinkedList) {
  if (linkedList.head === null) {
    return null;
  }
  const dequeuedNode = linkedList.head;
  removeHead(linkedList);
  return dequeuedNode;
}
```
