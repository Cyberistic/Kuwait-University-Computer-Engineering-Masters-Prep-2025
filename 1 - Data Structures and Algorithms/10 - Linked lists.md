Singly linked lists; circularly linked lists; applications - polynomial addition, sparse matrices; doubly linked lists, and complexities of linked list operations.


## Singly Linked Lists

A *Singly Linked Lists* is a list of nodes, each node has 2 properties:
1. Stored value
2. Pointer to next node

We can identify the tail (last node) of the last if its next value is `None`
