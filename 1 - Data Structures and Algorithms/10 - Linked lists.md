## Singly Linked Lists

A *Singly Linked Lists* is a list of nodes, each node has 2 properties:
1. Stored value (Can be a pointer to an object)
2. Pointer to next node (its "address" in memory)

The `class` of the list usually contain
We can identify the tail (last node) of the last if its next value is `None`
