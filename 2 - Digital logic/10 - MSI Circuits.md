MSI circuits (Muxes, Cross-bar switches, Decoders, Encoders, Priority Encoders), and the Verilog coding of those circuits.


Before we start, if you don't remember the verilog syntax, here's a quick overview: [[Verilog]] 

Note that I won't explain in details since you should have a general idea of how they work, instead, I will give a short description, typescript code and verilog.


## MUX

Based on input `s`, connect inputs 0 or 1 to f.

Note that you need log(n)
